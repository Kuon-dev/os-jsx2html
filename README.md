# JSX-to-HTML Converter

### IMPORTANT: 
Live server will spin down in inactivity due to running in a free instance, some initial lodas will be longer to wait for the server to start up. If the server took too long, I recommend you to refresh it.

## Description

This project is a Node.js-based utility from Babel to convert JSX React code into plain HTML. It is intended for rendering HTML elements based on the JSX code.

### Limitations
- No interactivity, no `useState` or `useEffect`.
- The `render` function is mandatory, otherwise React does not know what to render
